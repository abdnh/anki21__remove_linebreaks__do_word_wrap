This add-on tries to remove all line breaks from a field or a selection to make copy/pasting from PDF files less cumbersome. 

This add-on is an extended modification of <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1290231794" rel="nofollow">RemoveLinebreak</a> (which has been unchanged for over three years and looks abandoned).

This add-on offers some configuration options (like the shortcut).

<b># changes from the original version</b>
- if text is selected, only the selection is affected.
- can be called from context menu
- you can undo the action with Ctrl+Z
- tries to preserve double line breaks
- the function to batch process from the browser was removed.
- the add-on tries to remove "-" which are at the end of the line. A crude algorithm is used that might remove too much or too little. 

<b># Versions</b>
- 2020-05-11 always undo with Ctrl/Cmd+Z, keep formatting when replacing whole field contents. Both changes are made possible by moving the replacing code from python to js (in the webview).  Now the add-on always tries to remove "-" at the end of a line, there's no more user setting to deactivate this. If you still have such a user setting it will have no effect.
- 2019-04-11 initial release

<b># Problems, Bugs, Errors, Improvements</b>
There's a good chance that you'll find bugs. If you find one or have a bug fix or improvement you can tell me on  <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki21__remove_linebreaks__do_word_wrap" rel="nofollow">github</a>. I made this for me and I just need an add-on that mostly works. If you want an add-on that works in all cases don't use this add-on.
