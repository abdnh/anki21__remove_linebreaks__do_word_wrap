This add-on tries to remove all line breaks from a field or a selection to make copy/pasting from PDF files less cumbersome. 
This add-on is an extended modification of <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1290231794" rel="nofollow">RemoveLinebreak</a>) (which has been unchanged for over three years and looks abandoned).
This add-on offers some configuration options (like the shortcut).

<b>changes</b>
- if text is selected, only the selection is affected.
- can be called from context menu
- you can undo the action:
    - if you had text selected use Ctrl+Z
    - if the whole field was affected: You need to hold down the shift key and press the button of this add-on. There's no undo shortcut.
- tries to preserve double line breaks
- the function to batch process from the browser was removed.
- limitation: if you have a selection its formatting is removed
- the add-on tries to remove "-" which are at the end of the line. A crude algorithm is used that might remove too much or too little. You can disable this in the settings.

<b>Problems, Bugs, Errors, Improvements</b>
There's a good chance that you'll find bugs. If you find one or have a bug fix or improvement you can tell me on  <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki21__remove_linebreaks__do_word_wrap" rel="nofollow">github</a>. I made this for me and I just need an add-on that mostly works. If you 
want an add-on that works in all cases don't use this add-on.
